        <ul class="accomplishments">
          <li>Own SRE & DevOps for Verizon’s 5G Core Service Communication Proxy (SCP) & Network Repository Function
            (NRF)—Kubernetes/Openshift-native NF’s processing 40M+ subscriber devices and 1 billion peak req/hr across
            U.S.</li>
          <li>Overtook leadership responsibilities for 2 Distinguished Engineers who left the team to take over SCP &
            NRF,
            maintaining 100% application uptime and staying on-schedule with 6 major projects</li>
          <li>Triage 1–3 5G downtime incidents weekly using Kubernetes-level Grafana, Prometheus, and Istio telemetry
            via
            SCP to summarize 5G Core traffic trends and direct performance & operations teams to root cause</li>
          <li>Designed and implementing on-prem Kubernetes multi-cluster SCP capacity scaling framework to enable 500%
            traffic growth while improving debugging and traceability by partitioning traffic by ingress-traffic type
          </li>
          <li>Developed and patenting a DNS Edge mapping solution to SCP & NRF applications, cutting future resource
            requirements for capacity buildouts by 80% and accelerating deployment timelines by 2+ months</li>
          <li>Built Python tool to identify 1,000+ legacy 4G routing misconfigs, stopping outage scenarios valued around
            $200k each</li>
          <li>Manage Layer 7 networking for SCP & NRF with Istio service mesh, automating process with Python to add new
            FQDN’s to service mesh manifests—cutting ~4 hours off error-prone manual process building Kubernetes CRD
            manifests</li>
          <li>Created Grafana and Kibana dashboards for SCP/NRF OpenShift applications to surface ingress traffic by
            client, reducing triage time by 30% and informing org-wide capacity planning</li>
          <li>Migrated scattered BASH, Python, & Golang scripts and Kubernetes manifests to GitLab, speeding on-boarding
            process</li>
          <li>Mentor and upskill a cross-functional team of Distinguished, Principal, and Senior Engineers plus Oracle
            Resident Engineers and interns on 5G Core platform operations, maintenance windows, and incident response
            best practices</li>
